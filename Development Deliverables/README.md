Software Development
====================

"Comp523QTParamCp" is the directory containing the source code for the project, but also containing the Qt Creator-generated user file. Should be used by the project's developers.

"build-Comp523QTParamCp-Desktop_Qt_5_3_MSVC2013_64bit-Debug" contains the compiled binaries. Should be used by the project's developers.

"src" contains the pure source code that anyone could import since this does not contain a user file. **Should be used by anyone besides this project's developers.**
